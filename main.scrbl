An implementation of the @link["http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floydâ€“Warshall_algorithm"]{Floyd-Warshall} all shortest paths algorithm.

@defmodule[(planet jaymccarthy/floyd-warshall)]

@defstruct[path 
           ([cost number?]
            [edges (listof any/c)])]

A struct representing the path between two vertices. The edge list is really the list of nodes along the way.

Note: @scheme[cost] may be @scheme[+inf.0] and @scheme[edges] may be empty.

         (matrix? exact-integer? exact-integer? path?)]

Returns a matrix (from @schememodname[(planet wmfarr/simple-matrix/matrix-base)]) that is @scheme[how-many-nodes] by @scheme[how-many-nodes] where entry @schemeidfont{(i,j)} is the shortest path from node @scheme[i] to node @scheme[j].
